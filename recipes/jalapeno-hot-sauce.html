    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Hot sauces are a great way to add flavour to almost any food (maybe not your oats in the
        morning) with very few calories and tonnes of flavour!
    </p>
    <p>Of all the hot sauces out there my favourite would have to be jalapeno hot sauce. Not too hot
        and not too mild, with great flavour, jalapenos have to be the king of all chillies!
    </p>
    <p>Today we will me making a vingar based hot sauce. Thank Frank's hot sauce but green and even 
        more delicious (IMHO).</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500g Jalapenos</li>
        <li>1 white onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white vinigar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp cumin</li>
        <li>Coriander</li>
        <li>1 whole lime</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the tops off of the jalapenos, cut in hald length ways and remove the seeds</li>
        <li>Rough chop the onions and garlic and add these plus the jalapenos to small-medium pot</li>
        <li>Saute in oil with a pinch of salt for 2 minutes</li>
        <li>Add the vinigar as well as an addtional half cup of water</li>
        <li>Bring to the boil, then lower heat and simmer for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove from heat and let this liquid cool for 10 minutes</li>
        <li>Add all ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth</li>
        <li>Add a few sprigs of coriander, the juice of a lime and salt to taste</li>
        <li>Blend again to incorporate and you have your finished hot sauce!</li>
        <li>Additionally you can pass this sauce through a sieve for a slightly
            smoother and thinner consistency.
        </li>
    </ol>
