    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cheeseburgers! One of the great classics. Super simple to make and to customise to personal
        taste! 
    </p>
    <p>The burger we are making today is a classic cheeseburger consisting of a beef patty, cheese,
        tomato sauce, mustard and pickles on a bun.
    </p>
    <p>I'm a believer in a cheeseburger only being as good as the meat used to make the patty. So 
        you to go see your local butcher and get some high quality beef mince for this recipe.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Japanese milk buns</li>
        <li>High quality beef mince</li>

        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Bread and butter pickles (optionally you could make these yourself</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the beef with salt and pepper and mix together with your hands</li>
        <li>Form beef into 200g balls</li>
        <li>Heat fry pan to medium-high and place one ball of mince into pan</li>
        <li>Press the mince down to form a patty 25% bigger than the buns you're
            using.
        </li>
        <li>Cook until juice start appearing on the top side of the patty</li>
        <li>Flip the patty and add 2 slices of cheese, cook for an additional
            minute and then remove to rest.
        </li>
        <li>Cut the milk bun and place face side down in the pan you just
            used to cook the beef, and heat through
        </li>
        <li>Assemble the burger adding tomato sauce and mustard to both top
            and bottom buns. Add a layer of pickles to the bottom bun
            and top with your beef patty and cheese. Enjoy!
